    Project Description

        This PHP script processes a list of numbers and manipulates them using a set of operations
        that simulate stack movements and sorting techniques. The script applies operations such as swapping,
        pushing, and rotating elements between two arrays ($la and $lb). The primary goal is to rearrange
        the numbers through these operations.

    Usage Example

        Supposons que vous ex√©cutez la commande suivante :

            php script.php 3 2 1 "sa ra ra"
                
                The numbers 3 2 1 are stored in $la.

                The operations "sa ra ra" will be applied in order:

                    sa: Swaps the first two elements of $la.

                Before operation: $la = [3, 2, 1]
                
                After operation: $la = [2, 3, 1]
                
                    ra: Rotates $la upwards by moving the first element to the end.

                Before operation: $la = [2, 3, 1]
                
                After operation: $la = [3, 1, 2]
                
                    ra: Rotates $la upwards again.

                Before operation: $la = [3, 1, 2]
                
                After operation: $la = [1, 2, 3]
                
                The script will then output:

                    la: 1 2 3
                
                    lb:
                
                After applying these operations, the array $la is sorted in ascending order, and $lb remains empty.

    Functionality

        Input Handling

            The script accepts a series of numbers and a set of operations as command-line arguments.
        
            The numbers are taken from the command-line arguments, excluding the last argument, which is the
            list of operations.
        
            The operations are specified as a space-separated string in the last command-line argument.
    
        Operations

            The script defines several functions that correspond to specific operations:

                Swap Operations

                    sa(&$la): Swaps the first two elements of $la if there are at least two elements.
                
                    sb(&$lb): Swaps the first two elements of $lb if there are at least two elements.
                
                    sc(&$la, &$lb): Performs both sa and sb simultaneously.
            
                Push Operations

                    pa(&$la, &$lb): Takes the first element from $lb and moves it to the front of $la.
                
                    pb(&$la, &$lb): Takes the first element from $la and moves it to the front of $lb.
                
                Rotate Operations

                    ra(&$la): Rotates $la upwards by moving the first element to the end.
                
                    rb(&$lb): Rotates $lb upwards by moving the first element to the end.
                
                    rr(&$la, &$lb): Performs both ra and rb simultaneously.
    
        Processing Operations

            The script reads the operations and applies them sequentially to the arrays $la and $lb using
            a foreach loop and a switch statement.
    
        Output

            After all operations are applied, the script prints the contents of $la and $lb using
            the printLists($la, $lb)function.
